A simlpe math renderer for pytorch mathematical notations. Pytorch manual and documentation is written in rst format. The format is not compatible, and is not supported, by Jupyter notebooks. A minimal formatting on the documentation is done by putting `$ $` around inline math formulas and `$$ $$` around math blocks. The resulted string can be rendered by as markdown by Jupyter.
